# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze ride sharing data and generate tables and visuals to report on the outcomes of our analyses. 
## Results
Urban cities reported the highest ride counts of 1625, followed by Suburban(625), and finally Rural(125). Fittingly, we also see the highers number of drivers in that same order as seen below.

Urban cities also reported the highest amount of fares followed by Suburban cities and Rural cities in that order. See below

The average fare per urban rides was 24.53$. The average fares for Suburban and Rural rides were 30.97 and 34.62.

Urban cities had the highest total fares count of $39,854.38. Suburban cities had the second-highest total fares count of $19,356.33 followed by Rural cities with $4,327.93

## Summary

It appears that suburban and rural cities do not generate as much revenue as that of urban cities. Pyber could benefit from increasing efforts to focus on those cities. It could also be helpful to look into why these cities receive such a lesser amount of revenue than urban cities. One could assume because the rural and suburban cities are less dense than urban cities and thus the need for rides is not as frequent. In that case, PyBer could investigate alternatives such as shuttle programs or increased outreach to the communities. It could also be beneficial to add discounts in these cities to encourage users.
